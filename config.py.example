# Please note that config files are Python source code!
# A common mistake is to put an option list (such as TemplateChecks,
# JSONRPCAddresses, etc) excluding the final comma.
# For example (this is WRONG):
#     JSONRPCAddresses = (
#         ('', 8337)  # <-- there must be a comma after EVERY item, even last
#     )
# Without the final comma, should the option list ever have only one item in
# it, Python would interpret the "main" parenthesis as a mere sub-expression
# instead of a list of values. If that occurs, you might get crazy errors, or
# things might just not work correctly. Be careful to not miss the commas.

### Settings related to poolserver logging

# By default, significant events will be printed to the interactive console
# You can customize your logging using either simple parameters, or Python's advanced logging framework
# Note that using Python's logging framework will override the default console logging!

# To simply log everything to the system log (syslog) as well:
# LogToSysLog = True

# To make a log file:
# LogFile = 'filename.log'

# For a rotating log file:
LogFile = {
	'filename': 'filename.log',
	'when': 'midnight',
	'backupCount': 7,
}
# For details, see:
# http://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler

### Settings related to blockchain parameters

# The subsidy algorithm provided below is specifically for Bitcoin, where:
# - 5000000000 is the amount of the block reward
# - 210000 is how many blocks until the next halving
# This algorithm can be modified slightly for altcoins which calculate a block reward from only the height.
